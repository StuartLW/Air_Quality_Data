# Air_Quality_Data
Python procedures to download UK Air Quality Data. A port of many of the [open air project](https://github.com/openair-project/openair) importUKAQ routines from R to python. All the heavy lifting done by the open air team.
The functions return pandas data frames containing the results of the downloads.  The original files are held as R data files but conversion handled by the [rdata](https://github.com/vnmabus/rdata) package.
